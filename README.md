# Ruby Examples

A collection of short and useful ruby scripts for python guys and cobra gals.

## What is this?

A repo filled with toy example scripts to illustrate how to use `ruby` in a quick manner.

Note that this repository is meant to get someone from zero to _something_ in **very** little time, so don't expect to write the next web framework all by yourself immediately after reading the examples, but, hopefully, you will be able to write programs with medium complexity with relative ease.

Also note that a Python background (as can be noted in the project's description) is **extremely** useful. As I like to say,

> Ruby is just Python with `end`s and `do` blocks.
